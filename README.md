# GANTRY

Gantry is a custom JSON editor for Ivy Direct, my comprehensive portfolio experience. It enables editing and creating complex project metadata that I work with in a visual way, supporting future expansions, plugins, and more as well. It also statically generates the full-text RSS feed for Ivy Direct - which you can subscribe to at [work.ivy.direct/feed](https://work.ivy.direct/feed).

A previous version of this README stated that I would likely never come back to fix the issues in Gantry. I have since come back to fix the issues in Gantry.

## Features
- Visual list of JSON items, with ability to specify overview property
- Editable properties with pseudo-simulated result view
- Generate full-text RSS feed from GitHub plugin and Ivy Direct Markdown
- Restore JSON list from online catalog
- Supports arbitrary future expansions and plugins of schema

## Contributing and Usage

Gantry, while technically functioning as a separate app, is tightly-coupled to Ivy Direct source code and thus is really only useful for editing Ivy Direct metadata. Ivy Direct source code is available as sponsorware in a separate repository. If you are interested in using the Gantry architecture for your own portfolio, feel free to! I would love to see what you do with it.

PRs are welcome for issues in general.
